# Next Generation Certificate Transparency:

## Folders:

**`config`**: Contains the layout of private and public json configuration files used by Monitors and Gossipers. Also contains loaders for the object versions of these .json files.

**`crypto`**: Abstractions associated with CTng cryptographic implementations, and the cryptoconfig implementation.

**`gossip`**: Defines the Gossip object, the state object of the Gossiper, and many functions associated with running a gossiper.

**`GZip`**: Implements functions for reading arrays of bytes to a base-64 encoded, Gzip-compressed representation.

**`monitor`**: Defines the monitor server state and functions associated with monitor tasks, such as querying Loggers and CAs.

**`server`**: HTTP Server implementations for the Gossiper and Monitor. Should call functions from **`gossip`** or **`monitor`**, respectively.

**`util`**: a package that has no internal imports: helper functions and constants that are used throughout the codebase but prevents import cycles from occurring (import cycles are not allowed in go).


**`testData`**: Defines a configuration of CTng with 4 monitors, 4 gossipers, 3 CAs, and 3 Loggers. Also defines a fakeLogger and fakeCA HTTP client for testing.

# Running the code
**Note: CA,Logger, and revocator folder will not be used for the network test**  
  
Run `go install .` before continuing!

To run on WSL2:

**`a logger`**:  sh loggerTest.sh [loggerID]  

**`a monitor`**: sh monitorTest.sh [MonitorID]  

**`a gossiper`**: sh gossiperTest.sh [GossiperID]  

**`a CA`**:  sh CATest.sh [Certificate Authority ID]  

# Monitor Network

Each monitor number is connected to its corresponding gossiper number

Monitors are responsible for the "FakeCAs" and "FakeLoggers" (see those folders for info) as follows:

* 1 - logger1,logger2,CA1
* 2 - logger2, logger3, CA2
* 3 - logger1, logger3, CA1, CA3
* 4 - logger2, CA2, CA3

# Gossiper Network  
### Connections
Gossiper Connections are as follows:
* 1 - 2,3
* 2 - 3,4
* 3 - 4,1
* 4 - 1,2

Each Gossiper connects to the corresponding monitor number in 
monitorNetworkTest:
* 1-1
* 2-2
* 3-3
* 4-4

These servers are intended to provide a local test of all running components. The gossiper network can also be tested without monitors, although data must be sent manually + appropriately utilizing `client_test.go` to push data into gossiper 3.

The `testData` folder contains configurations for testing, but configs can be generated using the functions in `config`.


# Function Documentation
Documentation + Function descriptions exist in each file/subfolder.

To view this this info + documentation in a formal documentation setting, GoDoc could be utilized, but requires installing the repository locally as a package.

### Licensing
Both imports we use, gorilla/mux and herumi/bls-go-binary, use an OpenBSD 3-clause license. as a result, we use the same Please see LICENSE in the outer folder for details.
